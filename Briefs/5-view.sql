"""
    View is a data object which does not contain any data.
    Contents of the view are the resultant of a base table.
    They are operated just like base table but they donâ€™t contain any data of their own.
    The difference between a view and a table is that views are definitions built on top of other tables (or views).
    If data is changed in the underlying table, the same change is reflected in the view.
    A view can be built on top of a single or multiple tables.
